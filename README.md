# Welcome to My Ngram
***

## Task
We are to write a program that counts the number of occurrence of a character 

## Description
we used the ASCII concept to build the program, we used a for loop to loop through an array of strings, within the for loop block we used a while loop to loop through each string in the array.
we created a variable to hold the argv[i] array, then loop through each characterin the string and change the position of the loop.
we used a for loop to loop through the position of the ASCII, the if condition outputs both the character and its number of occurrence.

## Installation
No installation needed. The program can be run from the command prompt just like any other executable program


## Usage
From the comand prompt run the following script .\my_ngram arg1 arg2 arg3 where arg(n) are the string arguments supplied to the program to execute each character counting.
