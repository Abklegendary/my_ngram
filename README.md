## Task
we are to write a program that counts the number of occurrence of a character 

## Description
we used the ASCII concept to build the program, we used a for loop to loop through an array of strings, within the for loop block we used a while loop to loop through each string in the array.
we created a variable to hold the argv[i] array, then loop through each characterin the string and change the position of the loop.
we used a for loop to loop through the position of the ASCII, the if condition outputs both the character and its number of occurrence.
